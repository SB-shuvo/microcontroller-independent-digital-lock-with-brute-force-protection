# microcontroller-independent-digital-lock-with-brute-force-protection
The proteus simulation files for our digital-lock-project.

Using basic logic gates and without using anymicrocontroller, we have developed a password-based digital lock system. For a consecutive number of wrong attempts, the system will freeze for a certain time and prevent brute-force attacks. Password setting and resetting features are also included. Theuse of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) ensures that the password is stored even if the power supply is interrupted or turned off.
